excerpt: The primary visual cortex is commonly believed to provide the rest of the brain with a stable representation of the external world. Here, we tested this assumption by analyzing a massive, longitudinal dataset of fMRI responses to naturalistic visual stimuli. In this dataset, subjects were scanned intensively over the course of an entire year, enabling a novel data analysis method inspired by computer vision and machine learning. This approach produced a comprehensive characterization of brain responses over the course of the year-long experiment. We found that visual representations exhibited continuous and cumulative change over many months. Our results challenge the classic view that the visual cortex is a static image-processing module, instead suggesting that even the earliest sensory areas of the brain are constantly changing and adapting over time.

Abstract: Primary sensory regions are believed to instantiate stable neural representations, yet a number of recent rodent studies suggest instead that representations drift over time. To test whether sensory representations are stable in human visual cortex, we analyzed a large longitudinal dataset of fMRI responses to images of natural scenes. We fit the fMRI responses using an image-computable encoding model and tested how well the model generalized across sessions. We found systematic changes in model fits that exhibited cumulative drift over many months. Convergent analyses pinpoint changes in neural responsivity as the source of the drift, while population-level representational dissimilarities between visual stimuli were unchanged. These observations suggest that downstream cortical areas may read-out a stable representation, even as representations within V1 exhibit drift.
