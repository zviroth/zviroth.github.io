excerpt: 'Is it possible to study orientation selectivity in humans with fMRI? We showed that previous orientation studies were actually measuring stimulus vignetting rather than orientation tuning (Roth et al., eLife, 2018), but that doesn't mean that there is no true orientation selectivity in the fMRI signal. It is possible that true orientation selective signals are present, but are eclipsed or overshadowed by stimulus vignetting. In this project I developed an approach to measure true orientation selectivity that is not vignetting. We used 2 image-computable models to analyze V1 responses in the Natural Scene Dataset. One model accounted for stimulus vignetting, while the second model captured additional true orientation selectivity. Using this approach we managed to detect small but reliable orientation selective signals. We further revealed a coarse-scale radial map across visual cortex, a map that may underlie known perceptual biases.'

Abstract: Orientation selectivity in primate visual cortex is organized into cortical columns. Since cortical columns are at a finer spatial scale than the sampling resolution of standard BOLD fMRI measurements, analysis approaches have been proposed to peer past these spatial resolution limitations. It was recently found that these methods are predominantly sensitive to stimulus vignetting - a form of selectivity arising from an interaction of the oriented stimulus with the aperture edge. Beyond vignetting, it is not clear whether orientation-selective neural responses are detectable in BOLD measurements. Here, we leverage a dataset of visual cortical responses measured using high-field 7T fMRI. Fitting these responses using image-computable models, we compensate for vignetting and nonetheless find reliable tuning for orientation. Results further reveal a coarse-scale map of orientation preference that may constitute the neural basis for known perceptual anisotropies. These findings settle a long-standing debate in human neuroscience, and provide insights into functional organization principles of visual cortex.
